This proposal seeks to fully deprecate old locked QI by enabling the emergency withdrawal of old QI (0x580A84C73811E1839F75d86d75d88cCa0c241fF4) from escrowed QI (eQI) on Polygon.

Enabling this function will allow any users with locked old QI in the contract on Polygon to withdraw these tokens, regardless of unlock date.
