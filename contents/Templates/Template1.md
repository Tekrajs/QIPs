This is the suggested template for new QIPs. Note that Proposals number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your Proposal, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, qip-draft_title_abbrev.md. The title should be 44 characters or less

### Summary

In clear and simple terms, describe the proposal and its intended goal. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.

### Abstract

A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what will be done if the QIP is implemented, not why it should be done or how it will be done.

### Motivation

Here is where you should describe why the proposal is needed - the problem statement. It is critical that you explain why the change is needed. Please note that the solution description does not go in this section.

### Specification

### Rationale

The reasoning for the solution above should go here. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way? What were the considerations and trade-offs? The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

### Technical Specification

The technical specification should outline the changes to the protocol on a technical level.

### Configurable Values

Please list all values configurable under this implementation, if applicable.
